### Recipes 101 - The Burnt Toast Institute

Welcome to Recipes 101, the module that will teach you how to make edible meals without setting your kitchen on fire (we hope).

In this module, we'll take you on a journey through the most basic culinary skills, starting with how to turn on your stove and ending with how to make a sandwich (if you're lucky). We'll also teach you how to burn your hands on a hot pan and how to make a mess that not even your cat will eat.

At The Burnt Toast Institute, we believe that cooking should be a fun and memorable experience, even if it means setting off the smoke detector every once in a while. So if you're ready to graduate from frozen dinners and cereal, sign up for Recipes 101 and prepare to unleash your inner culinary disaster artist.

Course Objectives:

- Learn how to make simple and easy recipes that won't make your taste buds cry
- Develop basic knife skills (without losing a finger, hopefully)
- Avoid setting your kitchen on fire (at least most of the time)
- Impress your friends (if you have any) with your newfound culinary skills (or lack thereof)
- Embrace the chaos and have fun in the kitchen, even if it means wearing food stains as a badge of honor.
