# How to Make a Basic Vanilla Cake

A classic vanilla cake is a perfect dessert for any occasion. In this lesson, we'll go through the process of making a basic vanilla cake from scratch, step-by-step.

## Ingredients

Before we start, let's gather all the ingredients we need:

- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk, at room temperature

## Steps

Now, let's start making our vanilla cake!

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

3. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.

4. Mix in the vanilla extract.

5. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

6. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three parts, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients.

7. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix.

8. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.

9. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

10. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto wire racks to cool completely.

## Decorating the Cake

Now that your vanilla cake is baked and cooled, it's time to decorate it!

1. Level the cakes using a serrated knife or cake leveler.

2. Place one cake layer on a cake plate or stand.

3. Spread a layer of frosting over the cake.

4. Place the second cake layer on top of the first.

5. Spread a thin layer of frosting over the entire cake to create a crumb coat.

6. Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.

7. Apply a final layer of frosting to the cake, smoothing it out with a cake spatula or scraper.

8. Decorate the cake as desired with additional frosting, sprinkles, or other decorations.

9. Serve and enjoy your delicious vanilla cake!
