In this module, you'll learn how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) with JavaScript to create dynamic user interfaces. You'll explore DOM traversal and manipulation, including adding and removing elements from the DOM, and you'll learn how to use events to add interactivity to your user interfaces. By the end of this module, you'll have a solid understanding of DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
