## Short stories

A short story is a work of prose fiction that is typically designed to be read in a single sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or a series of incidents with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood. It is a crafted form in its own right, with its own conventions and traditions. Short stories can range in length from 1,000 to 4,000 words, though some can have up to 15,000 words and still be considered short stories. The genre has a long history, dating back to oral storytelling traditions and ancient epics, and it developed into its modern form in the early 19th century with the publication of collections of short stories.

### Oral storytelling

Oral storytelling is the act of telling a story through spoken language, rather than through written or visual media. It is an ancient form of communication and has been a part of human culture across the world for thousands of years. Oral stories can take many different forms, including myths, legends, folktales, and personal anecdotes, and are often passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. The art of oral storytelling involves using tone, inflection, and gestures to bring the story to life and create a strong connection with the audience. It is an important cultural tradition that continues to thrive in many parts of the world today.

#### Types of oral stories

- Myths: stories that explain the origins of the world or natural phenomena, often featuring gods or other supernatural beings.

- Legends: stories that combine historical facts with exaggerated or imagined events, often featuring heroic or legendary figures.

- Folktales: traditional stories that have been passed down through generations, often featuring animals or ordinary people as characters.

- Personal anecdotes: stories told about an individual's own experiences or adventures.

- Oral histories: interviews or recordings of people sharing their personal experiences and memories, often used in documenting history or cultural traditions.

- Epics: lengthy narrative poems that were composed orally in preliterate societies and later recorded in written form, often featuring heroic or legendary characters.

### Ancient epics

Ancient epics are lengthy narrative poems that were composed orally in preliterate societies and later recorded in written form. They typically focus on the extraordinary deeds of heroic or legendary characters, who are often depicted as interacting with gods or other supernatural forces. Ancient epics often reflect the values and cultural beliefs of the societies in which they were created, and they played an important role in shaping and preserving cultural traditions. Examples of ancient epics include the Iliad and the Odyssey, which were composed by the ancient Greek poet Homer, and the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, which are ancient Sanskrit epics from India.
