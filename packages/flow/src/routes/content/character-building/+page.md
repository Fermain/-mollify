Character building in creative writing refers to the process of creating, developing, and evolving believable and compelling characters that readers can connect with and care about. It involves crafting a character's backstory, defining their personality traits, motivations, desires, and fears, and exploring how they change and grow throughout the story. Good character development can make a story more engaging and memorable, as readers become invested in the characters' journeys and can relate to their struggles and triumphs. Effective character building also involves showing, rather than telling, the reader about the characters and their traits through their actions, dialogue, and interactions with other characters. Overall, character development is an important element of creative writing that can greatly impact the success of a story.

## Tips and tricks

Consider the following points to create well-rounded, believable characters that will help bring your story to life.

1. Start with a character profile: Create a profile of your character that includes their name, age, background, personality traits, likes/dislikes, strengths/weaknesses, and anything else relevant to your story. This will help you understand your character and make them more believable.

2. Consider their motivations: What drives your character? What are their goals? What obstacles do they face? These questions will help you create a character with depth and complexity.

3. Use backstory: Backstory can help you flesh out your character's motivations and make them feel more real. Think about their past experiences and how they have shaped who they are today.

4. Show, don't tell: Use actions and dialogue to reveal your character's personality and traits, rather than just telling the reader what they are like.

5. Give them flaws: Characters with flaws are more interesting and relatable. Think about what flaws your character might have and how these might play out in the story.

6. Allow them to change: Characters that grow and change throughout the story are more dynamic and engaging. Think about how your character might evolve over time.
