# Additional Lerna Commands

## Clean Node Modules:

If you ever run into issues related to dependencies, or simply want to refresh everything:

```bash
npx lerna clean -y && npm install
```

This command removes the node_modules from all packages and then reinstalls.

## List Packages:

To see which packages Lerna is managing:

```bash
npx lerna list
```
