# Creating Test Content

The LMS system uses markdown content stored in the content directory.
The exact location is:

```
packages/lms/src/routes/content
```

The system will automatically index this content and generate pages. The structure of the folders determines the navigation.

## Example Structure

Your content folder can look like this to define a particular institution and its content:

```
content
├── institution1
    ├── +page.md
    ├── programme1
        ├── +page.md
        ├── course1
            ├── +page.md
            ├── module1
            │   ├── +page.md
            │   ├── lesson1
            │   │   ├── +page.md
            │   ├── lesson2
            │   │   ├── +page.md
            ├── module2
                ├── +page.md
                ├── lesson1
                │   ├── +page.md
                ├── lesson2
                    ├── +page.md
```

Capitalised path names are not supported and each folder can contain a +page.md file. This .md file is indexed and used to generate a page. The folder name is used to define the page slug. The +page.md front matter is used to define the content type and its properties.

### Add page contents:

```ymal
---
title: lesson1
type: Lesson
summary: This is a lesson
previous: null
tags:

- Example Lesson
---

# Lesson Content Here

```

The **type** property is used to define the content type. The following content types are currently supported:

- Institution
- Programme
- Course
- Module
- Lesson
- Assessment

### Tags and Navigation

**Tags:** Use the **tags** property to list subjects that can be filtered on the search page or clicked on to find related content.

**Navigation:** The **previous** property defines the preceding item in the navigation. A null value indicates the page is the first item, meaning it doesn't have a prior page in the navigation menu.
