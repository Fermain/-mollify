# Future Implementation

A future goal is for users to simply run the following command to automatically install Mollify and its dependencies:

```
npm i @mollify/LMS
```

Then create a content folder with markdown files using the Flow editor, or migrate existing content using

```
npx mollify migrate
```

Then a user will be prompted to answer questions relating to the front matter of the content so it can be indexed and run as a website.
