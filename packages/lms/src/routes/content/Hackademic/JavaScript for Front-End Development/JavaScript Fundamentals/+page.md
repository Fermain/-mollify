# JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome to our JavaScript Fundamentals course! In this course, you'll learn the basics of JavaScript programming, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You'll also learn about the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use it to manipulate web pages with JavaScript. With our project-based learning approach, you'll build your own JavaScript programs and gain practical experience that you can apply to your own projects.
