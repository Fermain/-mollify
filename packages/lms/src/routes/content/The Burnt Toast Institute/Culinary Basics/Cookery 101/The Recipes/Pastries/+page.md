# How to Make Pastries

Pastries are a delicious treat that can be enjoyed any time of day. From flaky croissants to sweet fruit-filled turnovers, there are many different types of pastries you can make at home. In this lesson, we'll go through the process of making basic pastries from scratch, step-by-step.

## Ingredients

Before we start, let's gather all the ingredients we need:

### Pastry Dough

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small pieces
- 1/4 cup cold water

### Filling (optional)

- Your choice of filling, such as fruit, chocolate, cheese, or meat

## Steps

Now, let's start making our pastries!

### Pastry Dough

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.

2. Add the chilled butter pieces and use a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Add the cold water a little at a time, mixing with a fork or your hands until the dough comes together in a ball.

4. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

### Filling

1. If you're using a filling, prepare it now. Chop any fruits or meats into small pieces and mix with any other ingredients.

2. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

### Assembly

1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to the desired thickness.

2. Cut the dough into rounds or other shapes using a cookie cutter or knife.

3. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each piece of dough.

4. Fold the dough over the filling and press the edges together to seal.

5. Place the pastries on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

6. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastries are golden brown.

7. Let the pastries cool on a wire rack before serving.
