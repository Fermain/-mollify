### The Basics - The Burnt Toast Institute

Welcome to Cookery 101, the module that will teach you the most essential culinary skills at The Burnt Toast Institute.

In this module, you'll learn how to burn toast to a crisp, boil water until it evaporates, and cook eggs until they're rubbery and tasteless. We'll also teach you how to use a knife in the most dangerous and inefficient way possible, and how to burn down your kitchen with just a single match.

At The Burnt Toast Institute, we believe in taking the most basic cooking skills and turning them into an art form. So if you're ready to take your kitchen disasters to the next level, sign up for Cookery 101 today!
