Bread is a staple food in many cultures and is a delicious and satisfying addition to any meal. In this lesson, we'll go through the process of making bread from scratch, step-by-step.

## Ingredients

Before we start, let's gather all the ingredients we need:

## Steps

Now, let's start making our bread!

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.
2. Add the warm water and olive oil to the mixing bowl and stir until a sticky dough forms.
3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, until it doubles in size.
5. Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C) and place a baking stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat up.
6. Punch down the dough to release any air pockets and shape it into a round loaf or any other desired shape.
7. Place the dough on the hot baking stone or baking sheet and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
8. Let the bread cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
