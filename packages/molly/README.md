# Mollify Molly

## Description

Mollify Molly is an OpenAI-powered teaching assistant, designed to enhance the student learning experience by tapping into the lesson content to answer queries. The aim is to make learning more interactive and efficient with Molly's capabilities. We aim to expand Molly's functionalities to not only assist students but also teachers and content creators. In the pipeline, we have plans for Molly to aid in content creation with the Flow package. Its anticipated capabilities include facilitating the generation of quizzes and glossaries, thereby streamlining the course creation process. Furthermore, we also foresee Molly automating the creation of file frontmatter such as tags and summaries, leading to efficient management and categorization of course content. This could possibly even extend to automating the migration of content into the system, thereby streamlining the integration process.
